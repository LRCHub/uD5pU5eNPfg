Taking over, assisting with my revelation
Empty spaces, as if it was an invitation
Your invasion, exceeding every expectation
Now i feed from the many mouths of your persuasion
Resurrection, infection, as i fade away
Theres no fear, there is nothing left to make me stay
Fitting in my new skin, just tell me what to do
I'm defined, i am blind, i am a part of you
Big black bomb, attack
Break down resist us, fight back
Big black bomb, attack
Break down resist us, fight back
Big black bomb, attack
Break down resist us, fight back
Big black bomb, attack
Break down resist us, fight back
Big black bomb, attack

Break down resist us, fight back
Big black bomb, attack
Break down resist us, fight back
Big black bomb, attack
Break down resist us, fight back
Big black bomb, attack
Break down resist us, fight back
Big black bomb, attack
Break down resist us, fight back
Big black bomb, attack
Break down resist us, fight back
Now i am a part of you, attack
Now i am a part of you, resist us, fight back
Now i am a part of you, attack
Now i am a part of you, resist us, fight back
