Oh Mr. Kringle
Is soon gonna jingle
The bells that'll tinkle all your troubles away
Everybody's waitin' for the man with the bag
'Cause Christmas is comin' again

He's got a sleigh-full
It's not gonna stay full
He's got stuff to drop at every stop of the way
Everybody's waitin' for the man with the bag
'Cause Christmas is here again

He'll be here
With the answer to the prayers that you made through the year
You'll get yours
If you've done everything you should, extra special good

He'll make this December
The one you'll remember
The best and the merriest you ever did have
Everybody's waitin' for the man with the bag
'Cause Christmas is here again

He'll be here
With the answer to the prayers that you made through the year
You'll get yours
If you've done everything you should, extra special good

He'll make this December
The one you remember
The best and the merriest you ever did have
Everybody's waitin' for the man with the bag
'Cause Christmas is here again
Yeah, Christmas is here again
(Once more)
Yeah, Christmas is here again
